# Dactyl Manuform Build
## Parts
The case I used, I 3D printed myself. I didn't really want to spend time learning Clojure and designing my own version of the dactyl, so I used the one found in [this link](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform). Beyond that, I bought standard xda keycaps off of Amazon, as well as the diodes, copper tape, switches (Gateron Ink Black v2), arduino pro micro USB-C (I would recommend just getting the normal pro micros which are micro usb and then using a micro usb to usb c female extender), insulation tape for metal components, female RJ9 connectors, dupont wires, rubber feet, and a RJ9 coil. In addition, you'll probably need soldering equipment and a hot glue gun.
## Build Process
1. Decide on your key switches. The 3D model I chose appears to compatible with Cherry style switches so keep that in mind. Once you've decided and are confident that those are the switches you want, you put them all into your case and hot glue them such that they don't come out when taking off your keycaps.
2. Next, you need to wire the switches in a matrix. The switches you bought should have two straight metal pins below them. You want to use the copper tape to form columns of your keyboard. Depending on how thick your copper tape is, it may take between 30 minutes to an hour to complete one side of your keyboard. When finished, solder the pin to the tape. You can use a multimeter to test if electricity flows properly along the wire.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08076cde-a0e4-4de1-8021-a0c29c133f8a)
3. Wire the rows noting that the diodes do not go "black end to red end", rather, all diodes go "black end to black end". When finished, solder the diode to the pin and the diodes to their neighboring diodes. You can use a multimeter to test if electricity flows properly along the wire.![IMG_5193](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b38397ca-37e0-43d1-bf73-350de2d44545)
4. Here is a good time to solder the header pins to the arduino. I would advise to make sure the pins are entirely straight so as to minimize future problems.
5. From here, you want to connect your dupont wires to the end of each row and each column so you can then connect them to the arduino. You can find pictures online for where to connect the wires onto the arduino for the rows and columns.![IMG_5291](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b314d8d-e1b9-4c39-a385-bab908d44fe3)
6. Next, solder a dupont wire to all 4 of the wires of your RJ9 port and orient them such that they fit into the hole at the front of the keyboard. Connect them to the VCC, RST, and GND pins. Note that for the other side, it may not map one to one. For instance, if you use the green, red and black wires on the left side, you may have to use the yellow, green, and black wires on the right hand. I recommend using a multimeter and the connected RJ9 coil to ascertain which wires are actually connected on the RJ9 ports. Once you've done that, make sure to connect the wires that are connected, to the same port on each arduino.
7. Mount your arduino in the case. For me, because I used the USB-C versions of the pro micro which are large than the micro USB versions, it didn't fit into my case and I had to glue it in. This is why I recommend just getting the micro USB versions and using a micro USB to USB-C female extender to reach the front of the case. I would also recommend getting two such extenders so that you can continue to flash both sides in the future.
8. Once the rows, columnds, and RJ9 ports are connected to the arduino, you can move on to flashing the arduino. I recommend using [QMK MYSYS](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_distro_msys/releases/tag/1.9.0) to compile and flash your software. I recommend watching [this video](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_distro_msys/releases/tag/1.9.0) to understand how to change keymaps and the structure of the firmware. I would also add a mapping on both keyboards to reset the arduino or put it into bootloader mode. Once you have created a new keymap using MYSYS and compiled it, I recommend plugging in the left side, typing `qmk flash -kb handwired/dactyl_manuform/4x5 -km <name_of_keymap> -bl avrdude-split-left` (or something IDK) and then doing the same for the right side.
9. You're done, congratulations!
